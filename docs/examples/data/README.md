# Example data directory

Place CSV files used by the example prediction payloads in this directory.
The sample API client resolves the `data_path` in `docs/examples/farm_c_prediction.json`
relative to this folder, so you can drop `farm_c_asset_34.csv` here and run the
client without providing any command line arguments.
